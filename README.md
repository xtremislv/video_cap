# Video-Captioning

Video Captioning is a sequential learning model that employs an encoder-decoder architecture. It accepts a video as input and produces a descriptive caption that summarizes the content of the video.

The significance of captioning stems from its capacity to enhance accessibility to videos in various ways. An automated video caption generator aids in improving the searchability of videos on websites. Additionally, it facilitates the grouping of videos based on their content by making the process more straightforward.
